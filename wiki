# Using Ant-based Algorithm for Graph Coloring problems

This project uses a heuristic ant-based algorithm for the (classic) Graph Coloring problem and several of its generalizations, namely the Bandwidth Coloring, Multi Coloring, and Bandwidth Multi Coloring problems.

## Details

Code is written in C/C++
