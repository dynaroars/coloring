should be the most stable version (more recent than the other 1107 Stables .. but check to make sure 
it can recreate results using same seed).  The only diff is the JOLT,  so if something doesn't work then take the jolt out.



11/16  : PROBABLY the ONLY changes are 

1) localOpt (flip) only run at the end
2) Recolormorethan Q  change to  only change color of vertices with color > achievedK--
It seems that the highest goes down (which is a good thing) ... let's try put localOpt (flip) as before (not at the end)
----------


well have to take care of the weight thing 
weight neighbor  -> all cliques of subset (i) to all cliques of subjset (j) have the weights of weight(i,j)
weight self  -> all cliques of subset(i) have the weight of weight(i,i) among themselves ... have to check this 
is there weight(i,i) ???

BUG
1) don't add scores to configurations that's similar to previous ones , program not able to check this yet
2) When making decision, there could be color choice that's not in the pheromone score,  how to deal with it ?
