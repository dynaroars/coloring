*It is completed based on the ideas of Patel's original project*  I don't think KA did any major change, may be some changes in the parameters to play around etc.  

- Some changes made :

* Increase the Q_CHANGE_CYCLE by 4 times (advantage: allow more time for exploration, avoid premature convergence, disadvantage: the program runs longer)
